# Design of the Digital Data-Path of DDR5 PHY 

**Description:** This project aims at designing DDR5 PHY layer supporting write operation, CRC operation and all commands related to it. After understanding the standards governing the DDR PHY Operations (DFI, JEDEC DDR), we designed the PHY and implemented it using System Verilog (SV), we used Design Compiler (DC) to synthesis the block and Formality to make a verification of RTL vs. netlist. Finally we gone through the FPGA flow till downloading the bit file on the kit.
